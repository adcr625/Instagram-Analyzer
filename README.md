# Instagram-Analyzer
This Python project was made in sixth form as part of my computer science course.

Unfortunately, I no longer have access to the code file.
I do, however, have access to the project documentation.
I uploaded the project documentation, which includes screenshots and explanations as well as the full code.

The purpose and reasoning behind this project are explained in the documentation, but to sum up:

Implemented automated AI using Selenium to scrape data from the internet with one click. 

Scrapped data was compared, added, and subtracted from other scrapped data, which would 

It then outputs important data for the user to see.

Data included usernames, followers, and the number of followers the user currently had.

They were following, but not returning the favor.

Used Matplotlib to aid the user in visualising data with charts.

The aim of this project was to be able to compare following numbers with follower numbers.
